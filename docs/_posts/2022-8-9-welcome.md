Welcome to my blog. This time in English.

## Who?
I'm Samuel Kriikkula, a hobbyist programmer from Kuopio, Finland.
I've done some work as a teacher of programming and robotics for children and teenagers.
I'm currently interested in compiler design, neural nets, and pen testing.
Building and maintaining servers is very interesting to me as well.
I like Linux, although I sometimes use Windows for gaming and making music with FL Studio.
I have completed some courses for the Kajaani University of Applied Sciences.
I have an interest in entrepreneurship, and my hope is to someday start my own business.

## Why?
I write this blog mainly just for myself but you can come for the ride aswell! :)
I plan to discuss the topics of compilers, Linux, robots, A.I., hacking, programming, Rust (the language), programming language design, full-stack developing, or anything else that comes into mind.
